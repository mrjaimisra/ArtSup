## Purpose:

ArtSup is my personal project for Module 3 at the [Turing School](http://turing.io).
The site connects artists with supporters
by inviting artists to post examples of their work,
along with a description of their creative process
and a breakdown of the cost of making a piece in materials and time.

### Instructions
- run `git clone git@github.com:mrjaimisra/the_pivot.git`
- run `rails s`, access `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
- to run the tests, run `bundle exec rspec`
